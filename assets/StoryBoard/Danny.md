Danny: Oh crap, this doesn't look like La Soleil does it?

    I don't see ####### anywhere around here.

    Huh? Who's that?

    Hey, you, blue hair. Do you have any idea where I can find a hotel around here?

BF: beep bop

Danny: Huh, rapping?

    You'll take me to one if I can beat you in a rap battle?

    Alright, I'm sure it can't be *that* hard.

*ding sound*

Danny: I LITERALLY JUST NEED DIRECTIONS TO A F###ING HOTEL DUDE!
